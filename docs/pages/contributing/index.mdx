# Contribution Program

## Overview

Contribute code to Polkadot Cloud Applications and get tipped in DOT or USDT for your work. The Polkadot Cloud Contribution Program utilises the OpenGov treasury to disberse tips to contributors.

With the Contribution Program you can expect:

* __Mentorship__: Polkadot Cloud will provide mentorship to help you complete your tip.
* __Guaranteed Backing__: For every completed tip, Polkadot Cloud will automatically give __50,000 DOT Aye conviction__.
* __Full transparency__: The tip amount will be decided by the Polkadot Cloud team based on the complexity of the task prior to works starting.
* __DOT or USDT__: The tip currency will be applied bassed of your choosing.
* __Improved GitHub Portfolio__: Boost your GitHub history and CV by contributing to Polkadot Cloud Applications. Work on real-world problems to improve application-side Web3.

Upon completing a tip, Polkadot Cloud will open an OpenGov proposal on your behalf and disburse the tip amount upon the referendum successfully passing. 

<Callout type="warning"> OepnGov tips require a 28 day voting period whereby at least a 50% Aye conviction is needed to pass. Although tips are not guaranteed, Polkadot Cloud will maximise the chances of your tip passing by providing rationale for the tip and ensuring the tip is well documented.</Callout>
