# Welcome to Polkadot Cloud Docs

## Introduction

Polkadot Cloud Docs hosts all the information you need to use and develop Polkadot Cloud applications. 

We are currently building content around two initiatives:
- The [Polkadot Developer Console](https://console.polkadot.cloud).
- The [Contribution Program](/contributing) hosted by us at Polkadot Cloud.

We also host a [blog](/blog) where we share updates on the latest updates to Polkadot Cloud and its applications.

## Developer Console Docs Structure

The Developer Console documentation is split into three sections, that are separated based on the type of user you are:

- **[Basics](/console/basics/interface-overview)**: If you simply wish to use the console, this section explains each feature and how to interact with the console.
- **[Adding Resources](console/resources/adding-a-chain)**: If you wish to add resources, such as a new chain to the directory, this section outlines instructions on how to do so.
- **[Core Development](/console/development/installation)**: If you are interested in maintaining or growing the console with your own contributions, this section aims to detail the core concepts and structure of the console codebase.

Visit the [next page](/console/overview) for an overview of the Polkadot Developer Console project. This is a good first step whether you wish to use or contribute to Developer Console.

Thank you for your interest in Polkadot Cloud!
