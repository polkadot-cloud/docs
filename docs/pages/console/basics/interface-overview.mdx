# Interface Overview

![Interface Overview](/png/interface-overview.png)

The Polkadot Developer Console provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with various Substrate-based chains, including Polkadot, Kusama, and other compatible networks. The console supports Relay Chains, Parachains, and Solo Chains (Substrate-based chains that are not Parachains). The main components of the interface are:

## Tabs 

- Users can create new tabs to connect to different chains.
- Each tab represents a separate connection to a specific chain.

## Chain Selection

- Users can select the desired chain to connect to from a list of available chains.
- The list of chains includes Relay Chains (e.g., Polkadot Relay Chain, Kusama Relay Chain), Parachains, and Solo Chains.
- Users can search for a specific chain using the search box or filter chains by tags (e.g., Relay Chain, Canary Network, Test Network).
- Users can create custom tags to organize chains according to their preferences or project requirements.
- Custom tags allow users to filter and quickly access specific groups of chains that are relevant to their work (i.e. "Development," "Testing," or "Production" to group chains based on their purpose or stage in the development lifecycle.)

## Provider Selection

- After selecting a chain, users can choose a provider from a dropdown menu.
- The available providers may include Automata 1RPC, Dwellir, Dwellir Tunisia, IBP-GeoDNS1, IBP-GeoDNS2, LuckyFriday, RadiumBlock, and Stakeworld.

## Auto-Connect

- Users can toggle the "Auto Connect" option to automatically connect to the selected chain upon opening the tab.

## Connected Chain Interface

- Once connected to a chain, users have access to three main sections:
  - **Overview**: Provides general information and details about the connected chain.
  - **Chain State**: Allows users to explore and interact with the chain's state, including storage items, runtime constants, and raw storage.
  - **Extrinsics**: Enables users to compose and submit extrinsics (transactions) to the connected chain.

## Tab Management

- Tabs can be reordered by dragging and dropping them to the desired position.
- Tabs can be closed to disconnect from the corresponding chain.
- On the right-hand side of each tab, there is a "Manage Tab" icon that provides additional options:
  - **Rename**: Allows users to rename the tab for better identification.
  - **Auto-Connect**: Enables or disables the auto-connect feature for the specific tab.
  - **Disconnect**: Disconnects the tab from the connected API instance.

## Custom Endpoint

- In addition to the predefined chain directory, users have the option to connect to a custom endpoint by providing the necessary details.

The Polkadot Developer Console offers a streamlined and intuitive interface for developers to interact with different Polkadot and Kusama networks, making it easier to test, debug, and develop applications in a controlled environment.
