# Connecting to a Chain

To connect to a chain using the Polkadot Developer Console, follow these steps:

## Chain Selection

- From the main interface click on the "Connect" button next to the search bar.
- In the chain selection modal, you will see a list of available chains, including Relay Chains, Parachains, and Solo Chains.
- Use the search bar to quickly find a specific chain, or browse through the list.
- Each chain is displayed with its name and associated tags (e.g., Relay Chain, Parachain) for easy identification.
- Click on the desired chain to select it.

## Provider Selection

- After selecting a chain, you will be prompted to choose a provider.
- The provider dropdown menu lists the available providers for the selected chain, such as Automata 1RPC, Dwellir, IBP-GeoDNS1, RadiumBlo, Stakeworld, etc.
- Select the provider you wish to connect to from the dropdown menu.

## Connecting

- After selecting the desired chain and provider, the console will automatically initiate the connection process.
- During the connection process, you may see a loading indicator or status message to indicate that the console is establishing the connection.

## Connected State

- Upon successful connection, the console will display the overview page for the connected chain.
- The overview page provides key information about the chain, including:
  - Connected status and chain name
  - Specification name and runtime version
  - Latest block number
  - Runtime snapshot (a visual representation of the chain's runtime state)
- The "Connected to [Chain Name]" indicator confirms that the connection is active.

## Connection Management

There are two ways to disconnect from the current chain:

- **Close the Tab:**
  - To quickly disconnect from the chain and close the connection, simply click on the "X" icon on the right-hand side of the tab.
  - This will immediately terminate the connection and close the tab.

- **Disconnect from the Manage Tab Menu:**
  - Alternatively, you can click on the "Manage Tab" icon on the right-hand side of the tab.
  - From the dropdown menu, select "Disconnect" to terminate the connection without closing the tab.
  - You can also toggle the "Auto Connect" option in the "Manage Tab" menu to automatically connect to the selected chain when opening the console.
